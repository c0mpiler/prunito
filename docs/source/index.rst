Welcome to prunito's documentation!
===================================
A package providing tools for accessing and working with protein sequences and associated data.
The focus is on data from the |upkb|_.
This is reflected in the package name which is an anagram of UniProt.
UniProt has two sets of REST services, `uniprot.org <https://www.uniprot.org>`_ and the newer
|papi|_.
Additionally, a few tools for accessing services or working with data from the following resources are provided:

* `EuropePMC <https://europepmc.org/>`_
* `InterPro <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/>`_
* `ENA <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena>`_
* `EBI web services <https://www.ebi.ac.uk/seqdb/confluence/display/JDSAT/Job+Dispatcher+Sequence+Analysis+Tools+Home>`_
